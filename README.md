# tecda
Topsoe electrochemical data acquisition package - a Python library to crunch Maccor datafiles

This Python library can be used to dissect datafiles generated by all Maccor tester classes. The idea is to retrieve all relevant information from the full data file and then extracting the wanted information.

The wanted information can be direct measurement values or analysis of data such as the percentage of degradation over x cycles or time spent above a certain voltage.

Because the analysis has to match the individual test procedure and these vary greatly from lab to lab, you have to make your own analysis algorithms. However, the TECDA library provides you with the necessary tools to easily integrate all the analyses you want.
